    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>4 ounces silken or firm tofu, drained</li>
      <li>1 to 2medium scallions</li>
      <li>Two tablespoons red or white miso paste</li>
      <li>wakame seaweeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the water and kombu in a 1-quart saucepan over medium heat.
        Remove the kombu just as the water starts to come to a boil. Add the
        bonito flakes, if using, and let the water come to a rapid simmer.
        Simmer for about 1 minute, then remove the pan from heat and let the
        bonito steep for an additional 5 minutes. Strain the bonito from the
        dashi. Add extra water if necessary to make 2 cups. Alternatively,
        substitute 2 cups water, chicken broth, or vegetable broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the tofu, seaweed, and scallions. Cut the tofu into tiny cubes,
        1/4-inch to 1/2-inch on each side. Slice the scallions very thinly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the broth to a rapid simmer. Pour the dashi or broth back into the
        saucepan and bring to a rapid simmer over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the Miso with 1/2 cup hot broth. Place the Miso in a small ramekin
        or measuring cup. Scoop out about 1/2 cup of the soup and pour it over
        the Miso. Whisk with a fork or whisk until the Miso is dissolved in the
        water, and no lumps remain
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the Miso into the broth. Pour the dissolved Miso into the simmering
        soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the tofu. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the tofu to the
        Miso. Simmer just enough to warm the tofu, 1 to 2 minutes. Do not boil
        the Miso once the tofu is added.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the scallions. Just before serving, scatter the scallions over the
        top of the soup.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve in individual bowls. Pour the Miso into individual soup bowls and
        serve. Miso is best when served fresh. It will settle a bit as it sits
        in the broth, whisk briefly with chopsticks or a spoon to remix the
        soup.
